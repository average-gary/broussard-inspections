## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach

- Leverage PurpleStack template from https://github.com/purplebase/purplestack as the foundation
- Each task should be completed with accompanying unit tests using PurpleStack's testing framework
- Integration testing should be performed after every 2-3 tasks
- Regular code reviews should focus on security and Nostr protocol compliance
- Utilize PurpleStack's mobile-first design approach with cross-platform deployment

### Technical Priorities

- Prioritize data integrity and cryptographic security in all implementations
- Ensure proper Nostr event validation and signature verification
- Implement robust error handling and graceful degradation
- Focus on user experience optimization for Inspector field work

### Testing Strategy

- Test-driven development for core business logic
- Mock Nostr relays and Blossom servers for consistent testing
- Automated testing for all cryptographic operations
- Manual testing for user workflows and cross-role interactions

### Security Considerations

- All sensitive data must be encrypted before storage or transmission
- Implement proper key management and signature validation
- Regular security audits of cryptographic implementations
- Secure handling of payment information and zap operations
