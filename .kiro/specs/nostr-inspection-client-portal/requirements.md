# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a decentralized home inspection management platform with multi-role access control. The platform will support four distinct roles: Home Inspector, Client, Realtor, and Dispatch, each with specific permissions and capabilities. The primary focus is on efficient schedule management for inspectors while providing secure access to inspection data for all stakeholders. The system leverages decentralized technology advantages over traditional SaaS solutions and will be compatible with both web and mobile platforms using the PurpleStack template (https://github.com/purplebase/purplestack.git) for cross-platform deployment.
